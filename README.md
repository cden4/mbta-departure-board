MBTA Departure Board for North Station and South Station Commuter Rail

This web application uses the MBTA V3 API to retrieve and display current and upcoming commuter rail departures from North Station and South Station. It will show up to 20 departures, including scheduled and on time departures based on the current time as well as departures that are up to 2 hours late. The data/UI automatically refreshes every 30 seconds.

To deploy this application, copy all the files from the dist/my-app folder to a websever and navigate to index.html in a web browser.
